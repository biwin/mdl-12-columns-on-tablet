# Material Design Lite 12 Columns on tablet.

12 is the new 8!!


A Tweak on mdl to support 12 columns on tablet resolutions.



Sick of evenly dividing 8 by 3?

Just add this style to your style definitions just after the mdl styles.

forget about 8, its 12 now.

## Usage:
	
	<div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col-tablet">
		<!-- makes the tablet display 12 column wide -->
	</div>
